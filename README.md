# fishing
A python fishing game. Trust me, it's fun.

I promise I'll finish it someday.

## To play:
Go to <a href="https://www.online-python.com/">Online Python</a> and copy the contents of `fishing.py` into the code editor. Click **run** and click on the arrows at the bottom of the terminal sidebar to make the game fullscreen.
